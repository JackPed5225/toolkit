# Changelog

`sky-toolkit` follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) to help manage
the impact of releasing new library versions.

Toolkit is made up of two sub-packages, each of which have their own CHANGELOGs:

* [sky-toolkit-core](https://github.com/sky-uk/toolkit/blob/master/packages/sky-toolkit-core/CHANGELOG.md)
* [sky-toolkit-ui](https://github.com/sky-uk/toolkit/blob/master/packages/sky-toolkit-ui/CHANGELOG.md)
