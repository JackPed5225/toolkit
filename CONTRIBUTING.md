# Contributing to the toolkit

Contribution to the project is openly encouraged.

## Creating issues

Submit issues on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/sky-uk/toolkit/issues) for suggestions, recommendations, and bugs.

## Pull requests

1. Submit pull requests for changes and amends to the correct repository (UI or Core).
2. Get a code review by one or two devs. One of these **must** be a [core maintainer of Toolkit](https://github.com/sky-uk/toolkit#maintainers). (You need two :shipit: :shipit: left as comments on the pull request for when it's an addition, and one :shipit: for a patch, modification or small change).

## Discussion

Discussion of issues and general project talk is on Slack at #web-toolkit.
