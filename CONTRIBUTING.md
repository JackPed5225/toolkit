# Contributing to the toolkit

Contribution to the project is openly encouraged. These guidelines will be replaced with something more comprehensive once a structured build process is in place.

## Creating issues

Submit issues on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/sky-uk/toolkit/issues) for suggestions, recommendations, and bugs.

## Pull requests

Submit pull requests for changes and amends to the correct repository (UI or Core).

Pull requests should be squashed into a single commit and will not be merged otherwise. See [this article](http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-11-08-how-to-squash-commits-in-a-github-pull-request) for details on how to do so.

## Discussion

Discussion of issues and general project talk is on Slack at #web-toolkit.
