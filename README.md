# Toolkit

Sky's web Toolkit.

## Goals

- Enable teams across tribes to share common styles
- Provide a modular approach to handling CSS/Sass components
- Provide example use cases with a generated style guide

## Structure

The project consists of 3 repositories: 

- _this repo_: consumes the UI and Core layers and serves static pages
- [Toolkit Core](https://github.com/sky-uk/toolkit-core): Global styles and defaults for all projects
- [Toolkit UI](https://github.com/sky-uk/toolkit-ui): Aesthetic components following Polaris brand guidelines

## Versioning

The Toolkit follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) to help manage the impact of releasing new library versions

## Getting Started & Documentation

**Note**: The Toolkit is still in active development and not yet 100% stable. This means breaking updates may occur, minor issues and quirks may be present, and full browser support is not guaranteed.
